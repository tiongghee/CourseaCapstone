    "    <body>I made a trip to London recently and found that the accommodation is very expensive as compared to the other European countries. When I was choosing an Airbnb apartment, I had difficulty choosing which area to stay. With this project, I hope to be able to help other tourists, like myself, choose a neighborhood to stay in based on selected preferences. For example, Chinese restaurants, threaters, museum, etc. As there are too many <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_postal_district'>neighborhoods in London</a>, I will just focus on Western Districts.<br><br>\n",
    "    The targeted customers for my project will be tourists who are new to London, tourists who are trying to identify a new neighborhood to stay, or simply for tourists who are looking for a new neighbor to visit.<br><br>\n",
    "    Using the solution, the customers will be presented a list of venues and they will be able to select their preferences. Based on the selection, the customers will be recommended neighborhoods to visit.\n",
